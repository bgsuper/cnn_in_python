This repository includes the self-implementation of common convolutional neural network layers using plain python and numpy. These layers are the convolutional layer, relu layer, dropout layer, batch-normalization layer, fully connected layers as well as the classification layers (SVM, softmax). For each layer, the forward computation and the backpropagation are all self-implemented. The implementation has been vectorized to achieve a better efficiency. 

This implementation follows the instructions from Stanford convolutional neural network coarse (CS231n). This instruction can be found in README_CS231n.md.
